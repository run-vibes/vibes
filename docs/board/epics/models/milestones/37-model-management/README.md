# Model Management

## Overview

First milestone of the Models epic. Establishes the foundation for model management: registry for discovering available models, credential management for API keys, and the provider trait abstraction.

## Goals

- Model catalog with capability discovery
- Secure credential management (system keyring + env fallback)
- Provider trait defining the inference interface
- CLI commands for listing models and managing credentials
- Web UI for browsing models and managing credentials
