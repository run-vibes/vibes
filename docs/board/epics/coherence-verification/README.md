# Coherence Verification System

## Vision

Build a verification system that captures system behavior as visual artifacts (screenshots, videos), connects them back to story specifications, and enables early detection of drift between intent and implementation.

## Goals

1. **Visual Artifacts** — Capture CLI and web UI behavior as screenshots and videos
2. **Traceable History** — Connect any feature from idea → design → implementation → verification
3. **Autonomous Operation** — Clear enough rules that Claude can manage the board correctly
4. **Reduced Feedback Latency** — Catch coherence issues before PR, not after deploy
