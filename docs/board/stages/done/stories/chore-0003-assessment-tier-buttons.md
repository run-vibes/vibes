# Chore: Style Assessment Tier Filter Buttons

## Summary

Style the "Lightweight", "Medium", and "Heavy" tier filter buttons on `/groove/assessment` to match the CRT design system. Currently they are unstyled grey buttons.

## Requirements

- Consider tier-specific colors or visual differentiation:
  - Lightweight - subtle/dim
  - Medium - standard
  - Heavy - bright/emphasized

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Tier buttons use CRT design system styling
- [x] Buttons have appropriate hover/active states
- [x] Selected state is clearly visible
- [x] Consistent with other UI filter buttons
